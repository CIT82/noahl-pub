# My Day
### Morning:
Usually I wake up and spend some time in bed to let myself have a few minutes of mental rest before getting up.

After getting out of bed I get on my Computer and start sort of pre-planning what the day is going to be. It can range from any of the following: 
- Working on repositories
- Maintaining old code
- Video editing 
- Script writing
- Working on music
- Quick homework assignments

### Afternoon
I usually eat around noon, depending on how I'm feeling I'll go out and get something or just cook something quick at home.

After I eat I begin working on the stuff that takes longer, recently I ended up ~~creating~~ fixing a few causes bugs on a recent [randomizer project](https://github.com/potasium2/NSMB-Randomizer) I've been working on, as well as getting the project outline for that ready. It's still fairly buggy but at least it doesn't crash on startup anymore.

Whenever I finish working on whatever I have outlined for the day I then, usually, hang out with friends. A lot of the time its just hanging out and doing our own thing, sometimes we'll play games, but its nice to just hang out.

### Night
For dinner I'll usually cook something myself. A lot of the time I enjoy trying new food, like last night I made Halibut with Rice and Salad and it was pretty good, but most nights I find it easier to cook something I'm more familar with, like a Burger and some Fries.

Before going to bed I'll take a shower and brush my teeth, and read a book depending on the time. I've been reading <span style="color:blue;">House</span> of Leaves recently and it's been pretty good. I also recently ordered [The End of Everything](https://www.amazon.com/dp/198210354X?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) and I'm really excited for when that arrives.

### Side Note: 
**For the most part my days are usually completely unplanned. I find doing things as I want to do them to be more rewarding than doing them because I feel the need to. This mostly works because a lot of the work I do are personal projects and hobby work, with Homework fitting into a more niche schedule. For the most part my days can feature any of the above**
